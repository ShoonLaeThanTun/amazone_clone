# amazone_clone
This is an Amazon clone built using only HTML. It replicates the basic structure of an e-commerce website, including a homepage, product listings, and a navigation menu. While it doesn't include functionality like cart management or user authentication, it serves as a front-end demonstration of an online marketplace layout.
